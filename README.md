## üî• Run our Code

Create a new environment with python==3.9
```shell
conda create -n alignus python==3.9
```

Train the BART model
```shell
python train_model.py
```

After training the BART model, using the [ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) framework to generate post-training data with LLMs, the LLMs are constructed in **AlignUS.py** and **base_model.py**.
Then change the training data and checkpoint for the BART model.
Start to Post-train the BART model
```shell
python train_model.py
```

Test on the platform provided by ConvLab-3.
```shell
python script.py
```
